# üçü Good Fries üçü

I like fries. Maybe I love them. I don't know. But it would be rare occassion for me to say no to them.

You can be guaranteed that almost everytime we go out I'll order fries. Me and some of my friends have gone to quite a few places in town and have a word or two to say about their fries.

So this is our site. We want to lay down, by that I mean suggest, how you ought to make fries.

_**CAUTION**: We are not cooks_
